                Well, thanks then! My name is Jaume Nart Baron, and I'm from Barcelona, Spain.
                Since I was a little kid, I've been passionate about building stuff,
                tinkering pretty much everything and understanding how things work under the hood.
                It was pretty obvious I would end up as an engineer, and so I did.

                <p class="mb-0">I was originally supposed to become an engineer but the thought of having
                  to expend my creative energy on things that make
                  practical everyday life even more refined, with a loathsome capital gain as the goal, was unbearable to me.</p>

                What is that? What is a self-engineer?
                This name came up to me one day I realized that most of the knowledge I acquire comes from
                the self-study, being the internet and the community living there the main source. Education is changing,
                the knowledge shifted from schools and universities to a public source available to anyone called internet.
                What I want to do with this blog is to contribute to this community with what I've learnt thanks to
                the internet and make possible along with so many other bloggers that any person in the world
                have the chance to learn anything just a computer.

                Also, this is my technological repository, where I will store all my projects and knowledge acquired.

                  I left behind my student life 1 month ago. However I've already had my first work experiences.
                  I've been an intern in Procter & Gamble as an engineering project manager.
                  Now I'm doing an internship in Amazon as a robotics engineer.
