                Well, thank you for your interest!<br>
                My name is Jaume Nart Baron and I'm from Barcelona, Spain.<br>
                Since I was a little kid, I've been passionate about <em>building</em> stuff,
                <em>tinkering</em> pretty much everything and <em>understanding</em> how things work under the hood.
                It was pretty obvious I would end up as an engineer, and so I did.
              </p>

                <p class="mb-0">I was originally supposed to become an engineer but the thought of having
                  to expend my creative energy on things that make
                  practical everyday life even more refined, with a loathsome capital gain as the goal, was unbearable to me.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Isn't he right tough? Well, this blog aims to be the main drain of my creative energy technology-wise.
              Here I will post all my hobbyist technology-related projects, explained step-by-step so anyone can replicate them
              and learn.</p>

                  <p>Building a DIY 3D printer from scratch when I was 21
                  was by far the most important milestone for me as an engineer.
                  It's funny how somehting I did just for curiosity in my free time, turned out to be the beginning
                  of my passion for building, developing and prototyping. </p>

                  <p>My passion for electronics, networking, data analytics and data visualization in a single application?
                  That's the internet of things. There are plenty of open-source technologies that give hobbyists and engineers
                  limitless possibilities. For instance, I've already built my own home automation system which among other things,
                  lets me know if someone entered my room while I'm not there.</p>

                    Object detection, language processing and machine learning are some of the fields I'm more interested about.

                What is that? What is a self-engineer? It is basically the <em>DIY approach</em> to learning, building and
                getting things done. <br>
                This name came up to me one day I realized that most of the knowledge I acquire comes from
                the self-study, being the internet and the community living there the main source.
                <br>Education is changing, the knowledge shifted from schools and universities to a public source available to anyone called internet.
                There are tons of people sharing knowledge, enabling others to learn and making the internet the new land of opportunities.
                That I want to do with this blog is to contribute to this community.
                In the future, a computer will be the greatest expression of freedom.

                  During my engineering studies, I have had few work experiences as an intern.

                  where I worked as an engineering project manager in Brussels, Belgium.
                  Now I'm heading to Italy, near Milan, to do an internship in Amazon as a robotics engineer.
