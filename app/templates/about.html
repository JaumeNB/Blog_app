                Well, thank you for your interest!<br>
                My name is Jaume Nart Baron and I'm from Barcelona, Spain.<br>
                Since I was a little kid, I've been passionate about <em>building</em> stuff,
                <em>tinkering</em> pretty much everything and <em>understanding</em> how things work under the hood.
                It was pretty obvious I would end up as an engineer, and so I did.

                <p class="mb-0">I was originally supposed to become an engineer but the thought of having
                  to expend my creative energy on things that make
                  practical everyday life even more refined, with a loathsome capital gain as the goal, was unbearable to me.</p>

              and learn.</p>

                Now, you might be asking yourself: What is a <em>self-engineer</em>?
                <br>
                This nickname came to me after my graduation as an engineer. I realized that, what differentiates me from other engineers is not the amount of hours
                I've studied more or less than them, nor the different subjects or even degrees we've coursed. The <em>difference and <strong>value</strong></em> lies on the extra quality time comitted
                to things I'm passionate about beyond the university duties. The <em>difference lies on all the self-study, Do It Yourself projects and self-learning done thanks to the <b>Internet</b>
                and its amazing community of truly passionate teachers and learners</em>.</p>

              <em><h4 class="card-title">My career</h4></em>
                <p class="card-text">
                  On March 1st, 2018, I graduated with a <em>MSc in Industrial Engineering at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya</em>.
                  <br>
                  But how even a person who is writing posts about computer science and software development graduated as an Industrial Engineer?
                  <br>
                  Well, when I was 18 and had to choose my studies, I was mainly passionate about hardware and mechanics. I didn't have any interest for
                  software development or any other similar subject. However, I did a wise choice. As I wasn't completely sure what I wanted to be as a professional,
                  I chose a very generic engineering degree: <i>Industrial Engineering</i>.
                  <br><br>
                  That kept all the doors open career-wise, even for the radical change I've made.
                  In this degree, I coursed a wide range of engineering subjects: physics, mathematics, statistics, fluid-dynamics, materials,
                  electric engineering, electronics, computer science (yes, as well), project management and even marketing and business management.
                  It might sound weird to you, but that's what Industrial Engineering is all about in Spain, doing a little bit of everything and doing nothing at the same time.
                  <br><br>
                  As the years passed by, my interest for electronics, networking and computer science increased and thanks to my abroad experiences (Besides Spain, I've studied
                  in Poland, Italy and France) and the broad studies I've coursed, I have been able to shape my studies as desired, which is great.
                  Also, while studying, I've had several real-work experiences in the form of internships. For more details, please refer to my resume which is attached below.
